By using Encode-Decode-Craft, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal data.**

The extension operates completely locally within your browser. All data processing (transformations, encoding, decoding) happens on your device.

### 1.1 Clipboard Data

- **Permision**: `clipboardRead`
- **Usage**: The extension accesses your clipboard **only** when you explicitly open the extension popup. This is done to automatically paste the clipboard content into the input field for your convenience.
- **Storage**: This data is never sent to any external server or stored persistently by the extension. It remains in your browser's local memory for the duration of your session.

### 1.2 User Input

- **Usage**: Any text you type or paste into the extension is used solely for the purpose of the requested transformation (e.g., JSON formatting, Base64 encoding).
- **Storage**: Input data is not saved or tracked.

## 2. Permissions

We request the minimum permissions necessary for the extension to function:

- **`clipboardRead`**: To auto-read your clipboard content into the workspace when the extension opens.
- **`clipboardWrite`** (Optional): To allow you to copy the result back to your clipboard via the "Copy" button.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This extension may load static resources (fonts or images) from the following third-party content delivery networks (CDNs):

- **Google Fonts**: Used for typography.
- **Cloudinary**: Used to host the extension logo/icon.

These services may collect standard web log information (like IP addresses) for security and performance purposes, governed by their respective privacy policies. We do not share any user content with them.
